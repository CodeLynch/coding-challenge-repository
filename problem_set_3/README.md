# Problem Set 3: Longest Increasing Subsequence
## Problem Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
<br/><br/>
For context. The "Longest Increasing Subsequence" is a common problem in computer science and dynamic programming. In the context of an array of integers, the goal is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given array such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
<br/><br/>
Here's a more detailed explanation:
<br/>
**Subsequence**: A subsequence is a sequence of elements that appear in the same order as they
are in the original sequence, but not necessarily consecutively.
<br/>
**Increasing Subsequence**: An increasing subsequence is a subsequence in which the elements are
in strictly increasing order.
<br/><br/>
The "Longest Increasing Subsequence" problem asks for the length of the longest increasing subsequence in a given array. For example, given the array: [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
<br/><br/>
One possible increasing subsequence is [2, 5, 7, 18], and the length of this subsequence is 4. The goal
is to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence for a given array.
<br/><br/>
Solving this problem efficiently often involves dynamic programming techniques, where you build up a
solution for each subproblem and use those solutions to solve the overall problem.
